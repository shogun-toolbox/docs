#Installing Shogun

For certain systems, we offer pre-built packages of Shogun. This is the easiest
way to start using it. For other cases, we describe how to build Shogun from source code.

##Ready-to-install packages <a name="binaries"></a>

###Ubuntu ppa <a name="ubuntu"></a>
We are working on integrating Shogun with Debian/Ubuntu. In the meantime, we offer a
[prepackaged ppa](https://launchpad.net/~shogun-toolbox/+archive/ubuntu/stable).
These currently do contain the C++ library and Python bindings.
Add this to your system as
    
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:shogun-toolbox/stable
    $ sudo apt-get update
    
Then, install as

    $ sudo apt-get install libshogun17

The Python (2) bindings can be installed as

    $ sudo apt-get install python-shogun

In addition to the latest stable release, we offer [nightly builds](https://launchpad.net/~shogun-toolbox/+archive/ubuntu/nightly) of our
development branch.

###Debian <a name="debian"></a>
Latest packages for Debian jessie are available in our own repository at
[http://apt.shogun.ml](http://apt.shogun.ml). We provide both the stable
and nightly packages, currenlty only for amd64 architecture.
In order to add the stable packages to your system, simply run the following commands

    $ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3DD2174ACAB30365
    $ echo "deb http://apt.shogun.ml/ jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shogun-toolbox.list  > /dev/null
    $ sudo apt-get update

After this just simply install the shogun library

    $ sudo apt-get install libshogun17

The nightly packages are available in the `nightly` component, i.e.
`deb http://apt.shogun.ml/ jessie nightly`

###Fedora <a name="fedora"></a>
Shogun is part of [Fedora 25](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/shogun/).
Install as

    $ sudo dnf install shogun
    
    
###Mac <a name="mac"></a>
Shogun is part of [homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science). Install the latest stable version as

    $ sudo brew install shogun

###Windows <a name="windows"></a>
We currently do not support a Shogun binary on Windows platform. Shogun natively compiles under Windows using MSVC. It is recommended to use " Visual Studio 14 2015 " or " MSBuild " to build Shogun which both have good support to C++11. 

Run CMD as administrator with the following commandsï¼š
```
git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git C:\projects\shogun 
git submodule -q update --init
```
Move to the source tree root and create the build directory.
```
cd C:\projects\shogun
md build && cd build
```
You need [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to build Shogun. If you need Shogun examples in build, please see [Examples](#manual-examples).
```
cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_META_EXAMPLES=OFF -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
```
Compile
```
msbuild "C:\projects\shogun\build\shogun.sln" /verbosity:minimal /t:Clean /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```
Note: If you use `/m` in msbuild command without specifying the number, it may occur out of memory errors. See [CI build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vigsterkr/shogun) as a reference and [Compiling manually](#manual) for more details. If you are interested in packaging, documenting, or contributing otherwise, please contact us.

##Docker images <a name="docker"></a>
You can run Shogun in [our own cloud](cloud.shogun.ml) or set up your own using our
[Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/shogun/shogun-dev/) as:

    $ sudo docker pull shogun/shogun
    $ sudo docker run -it shogun/shogun bash
    
We offer images for both the latest release and nightly development builds.
    
Sometimes mounting a local folder into the docker image is useful. 
You can do this via passing an additional option

```
-v /your/local/folder:/same/folder/in/docker
```

See the Docker documentation for further details.


##Integration with interface language build systems <a name="language"></a>
Shogun is can be automatically built from source from the following langauges.

###Python pypi <a name="pypi"></a>
You can install from [pipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shogun-ml/). There is limited control over options and it might take a long time as everything is done from scratch.

    $ pip install shogun-ml
    
We do not reccomend this option and suggest to rather compile by hand as described below.


#Compiling manually <a name="manual"></a>

In case none of the binary packages listed on our website work for your system, or you want to modify Shogun, you will need to build it from source.

##Requirements <a name="manual-requirements"></a>
The standard GNU/Linux tools and Python are minimal requirements to compile Shogun.
To compile the interfaces, in addition to [swig](http://www.swig.org/) itself, you will need language specific development packages installed, see [interfaces](#manual-interfaces) below.

There is a larger number of optional requirements. The output of cmake output lists
optional dependencies that were found and not found.
If a particular Shogun class is unavailable, this is likely due to an unmet dependency.
See our [docker configuration file](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/configs/shogun/Dockerfile) for an example configuration used in our test builds.

You need at least 1GB free disk space. If you compile any interface, roughly 4 GB RAM are need (we are working on reducing this). [CCache](https://ccache.samba.org/) will massively speed up the compilation process and is enabled by default if installed.

##Basics <a name="manual-basics"></a>
Shogun uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for its build. The general workflow is now explained. For further details on testing etc, see [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md).

Download the latest [stable release source code](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/releases/latest), or (as demonstrated here) clone the latest develop code. Potentially update submodules

    $ git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
    $ git submodule update --init
    
Create the build directory in the source tree root

    $ cd shogun
    $ mkdir build
    
Configure cmake, from the build directory, passing the Shogun source root as argument.
It is recommended to use any of CMake GUIs (e.g. replace `cmake ..` with `ccmake ..`),
in particular if you feel unsure about possible parameters and configurations.
Note that all cmake options read as `-DOPTION=VALUE`.

    $ cd build
    $ cmake [options] ..
    
Compile

    $ make

    
Install (prepend `sudo` if installing system wide). Done.

    $ make install

Sometimes you might need to clean up your build (e.g. in case of some major
changes). First, try

    $ make clean

If that does not help, try removing the build directory and starting from scratch afterwards

    $ rm -rf build

If you prefer to not run the `sudo make install` command system wide, you can
either install Shogun to a custom location (`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/path`, defaults to `/usr/local`), or even skip `make install` at all.
In both cases, it is necessary to set a number of system libraries for using Shogun,
see [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md).

##Interfaces <a name="manual-interfaces"></a>
The native C++ interface is always included.
The cmake options for building interfaces are `-DPythonModular -DOctaveModular -DRModular -DJavaModular -DRubyModular -DLuaModular -DCSharpModular` etc. For example, replace the cmake step above by
```
cmake -DPythonModular=ON [potentially more options] ..
```

The required packages (here debian/Ubuntu package names) for each interface are
 * Python
   - `python-dev python-numpy`
 * Octave
   - `octave liboctave-dev`
 * R
   - `r-base-core`
 * Java
   - `oracle-java8-installer`, non-standard, e.g. `https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team/+archive/ubuntu/java`
   - `jblas`, a standard third party library, `https://mikiobraun.github.io/jblas/`
 * Ruby
   - `ruby ruby-dev`, and `narray` a non-standard third party library, `http://masa16.github.io/narray/`, install with `gem install narray`
 * Lua
   - `lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev`
 * C-Sharp
   - `mono-devel mono-gmcs cli-common-dev`

To *use* the interfaces, in particular if not installing to the default system-wide location, see [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md).
See [examples](#manual-examples) below for how to create the examples from the website locally.

##Generating examples <a name="manual-examples"></a>
All Shogun examples at our website are automatically generated code. You can
generate them (plus additional ones) locally (needs cmake switch `-DBUILD_META_EXAMPLES=ON`)

    $ make meta_examples

This requires [PLY for Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ply), package `python-ply`, and [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), package `ctags`. Both source code and potential executables (C++, Java, C-Sharp) are created in `build/examples/meta/` when running
`make`.

See [INTERFACES.md](INTERFACES.md) to run the generated examples and see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for more details on their mechanics. See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for how the examples are used as tests.

##Problems? Got stuck? Found a bug? Help?  <a name="manual-problems"></a>

In case you have a problem building Shogun, please open an [issue on github](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues) with your system details, *exact* commands used, and logs posted as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).
